# Enhanced Hybrid Model Training - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented enhancements to `train_hybrid_models.py` to predict 0.5%+ hourly price increases while maintaining 15-minute data granularity and adding comprehensive class imbalance handling.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Target Prediction Enhancement ✅
- **Changed prediction horizon**: From 1 period (15 minutes) to 4 periods (1 hour)
- **Enhanced target calculation**: Now predicts if price will increase by 0.5%+ within the next hour by finding the maximum price within the 4-period horizon
- **Maintained granularity**: Preserved 15-minute data granularity for all features
- **Validated logic**: Comprehensive testing confirms correct target calculation

### 2. Class Imbalance Handling ✅
- **Automatic class weight calculation**: Uses inverse frequency weighting for both LSTM and XGBoost
- **Weighted binary crossentropy**: LSTM now uses class weights during training
- **Enhanced XGBoost balancing**: Proper `scale_pos_weight` configuration
- **Detailed logging**: Class distribution and weights are logged during training

### 3. Multi-Timeframe Feature Engineering ✅
- **17 new multi-timeframe features** added across 15min, 30min, 1h, 2h, 4h intervals:
  - `price_change_30min`, `volatility_30min`, `volatility_1h`, `volatility_4h`
  - `vol_ratio_15min_30min`, `vol_ratio_30min_1h`, `vol_ratio_1h_4h`
  - `momentum_30min`, `momentum_1h`, `momentum_2h`, `momentum_4h`
  - `momentum_alignment_short`, `momentum_alignment_all`
  - `price_vs_ema_30min`, `price_vs_ema_1h`, `price_vs_ema_2h`, `price_vs_ema_4h`
- **Cross-timeframe analysis**: Volatility ratios and momentum alignment features
- **Enhanced pattern detection**: Multi-timeframe momentum convergence indicators

### 4. Model Architecture Updates ✅
- **LSTM improvements**: Binary classification with weighted loss and enhanced performance logging
- **XGBoost enhancements**: Extended feature set with 10+ new multi-timeframe features
- **Preserved compatibility**: Output format remains compatible with signal generator
- **Enhanced metrics**: Added precision, recall, and detailed performance reporting

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Target Logic
```python
# Calculate the maximum price reached within the next 4 periods (1 hour)
future_prices = df["close"].shift(-self.prediction_horizon).rolling(
    window=self.prediction_horizon, min_periods=1
).max()
max_price_change = (future_prices - df["close"]) / df["close"]
targets = (max_price_change >= self.price_change_threshold).astype(float)
```

### Class Balancing Implementation
```python
# Calculate class weights (inverse frequency)
class_weights = {}
for class_idx, count in zip(unique_classes, class_counts):
    class_weights[class_idx] = total_samples / (len(unique_classes) * count)

# Apply to LSTM training
history = model.fit(
    train_dataset,
    validation_data=val_dataset,
    class_weight=class_weights,  # Automatic class balancing
    # ... other parameters
)
```
