# Enhanced Cryptocurrency Price Jump Detection - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation enhances the hybrid LSTM + XGBoost model to better predict cryptocurrency price jumps of 0.5% or higher within 15-minute intervals.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Redefined Target Variable (âœ… Completed)
**File: `train_models/train_hybrid_models.py`**
- Changed LSTM target from continuous price prediction to binary jump detection
- Both LSTM and XGBoost now use consistent â‰¥0.5% jump classification
- Updated loss function from quantile loss to binary crossentropy
- Changed output activation from linear to sigmoid for binary classification

```python
# Before: Continuous prediction targets
targets = (df["close"].pct_change(self.prediction_horizon).shift(-self.prediction_horizon).values)

# After: Binary jump detection targets  
targets = ((df["close"].pct_change(self.prediction_horizon).shift(-self.prediction_horizon) >= self.price_change_threshold).astype(float).values)
```

#### Jump Probability Calculation
```python
def _calculate_jump_probability(self, predictions, confidence_scores, jump_features_active):
    # Combines model predictions (50%), confidence (30%), and feature activity (20%)
    jump_probability = (
        0.5 * avg_prediction +
        0.3 * avg_confidence + 
        0.2 * feature_contribution
    )
```

#### Adaptive Ensemble Weighting
- LSTM weight boosted by 30% for high jump probability
- XGBoost weight boosted by 20% for high jump probability
- Signal strength enhanced for jump scenarios

### 6. Enhanced Signal Generation (âœ… Completed)
**File: `paper_trader/strategy/signal_generator.py`**

#### Jump-Focused Trading Logic
- Separate `_generate_jump_buy_signal()` method
- Enhanced position sizing for high-probability jumps (up to 1.5x base size)
- More aggressive take-profit targets (minimum 0.8%, up to 1.2% for high probability)
- Tighter stop-loss levels (0.6% for jump trades)

#### Jump Detection Criteria
```python
is_jump_candidate = (
    price_change_pct > self.min_expected_gain_pct and 
    (jump_probability > 0.5 or 
     prediction.get('jump_features_active', 0) > 3 or
     signal_strength in ['STRONG', 'VERY_STRONG'])
)
```

    'jump_probability': 0.73,         # High jump likelihood
    'jump_features_active': 6,        # 6 jump features triggered
    'signal_strength': 'STRONG',      # Enhanced by jump probability
    'signal_type': 'JUMP_FOCUSED',    # Jump-optimized trade
    'position_size_pct': 0.12,        # 1.5x base size for high confidence
    'take_profit': 0.012,             # 1.2% target for jump trade
    'stop_loss': 0.006                # Tight 0.6% stop loss
}
