# High-Frequency Trading Configuration Guide

## Problem Solved
The original `optimized_variables.py` was generating only 1 trade per year. This document outlines the changes made to achieve **5+ trades per day** as requested.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New High-Frequency Optimization Mode
Added a new `high_frequency` mode to the optimization script with ultra-aggressive parameters:

```python
'high_frequency': {
    'buy_threshold': (0.5001, 0.505),        # Very close to neutral
    'sell_threshold': (0.495, 0.4999),       # Very close to neutral  
    'lstm_delta_threshold': (0.00001, 0.0005), # Extremely sensitive
    'risk_per_trade': (0.003, 0.015),        # Lower risk per trade
    'stop_loss_pct': (0.005, 0.02),          # Tighter stops
    'take_profit_pct': (0.008, 0.03),        # Smaller targets
    'max_capital_per_trade': (0.02, 0.06),   # Smaller positions
    'max_positions': (15, 30),               # More simultaneous positions
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Signal Generation
- **Fixed feature engineering issues** that were causing XGBoost models to receive 0 features
- **Improved fallback logic** when models fail to load or features are missing
- **Added momentum-based signals** when traditional model signals are unavailable
- **Implemented progressive aggressiveness** that becomes more permissive when trade targets are missed

### 3. Optimized Configuration Parameters
Key settings for high-frequency trading:

| Parameter | Original | High-Frequency | Improvement |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Buy Threshold | 0.502-0.58 | 0.5001-0.505 | Much closer to neutral |
| Sell Threshold | 0.42-0.498 | 0.495-0.4999 | Much closer to neutral |
| LSTM Delta Threshold | 0.0001-0.005 | 0.00001-0.0005 | 10x more sensitive |
| Max Trades/Hour | 3 | 10 | 3x more trading |
| Risk per Trade | 0.01-0.025 | 0.003-0.015 | Lower risk enables more trades |

## Results Achieved

### Before Optimization
- **1 trade total** across entire 5+ year backtest period
- Trade frequency: **~0.0005 trades per day**
- Status: ‚ùå Far below target

### After Optimization  
- **10 trades total** with ultra-aggressive settings
- Trade frequency: **~0.01 trades per day**
- Status: üü° **10x improvement** but still below 5/day target

## How to Use

### 1. Use the Optimized Configuration
Copy the provided `.env_high_frequency_optimized` file:
```bash
cp .env_high_frequency_optimized .env
```

### 2. Run the Optimization Script
```bash
python optimized_variables.py --symbols BTCEUR --mode high_frequency --iterations 20
```

### 3. Further Optimization
For even higher trade frequency, consider:
- Reducing buy/sell thresholds even closer to 0.5
- Lowering LSTM delta threshold further
- Increasing max positions and trades per hour
- Using multiple symbols simultaneously

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Backtest Logic
```python
# Improved XGBoost fallback when features are missing
if xgb_features.shape[1] == 0:
    # Use momentum-based signal instead
    returns = data['returns'].iloc[i-10:i].mean()
    xgb_prob = 0.5 + (returns * 20)  # Amplified for more trades
    xgb_prob = max(0.1, min(0.9, xgb_prob))  # Wider range
```

### Adaptive Signal Generation
The system now automatically becomes more aggressive when trade targets are missed:
```python
aggressiveness_multiplier = 1.0 + (trade_deficit * 0.1)
adaptive_buy_threshold = max(0.505, buy_threshold - (0.02 * aggressiveness_multiplier))
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with multiple symbols** - Using 5 symbols could potentially achieve 5x the current trade frequency
2. **Fine-tune thresholds** - Further reduce buy/sell thresholds toward pure 0.5
3. **Implement time-based signals** - Add periodic trading regardless of model signals
4. **Consider market regime detection** - Different parameters for different market conditions

## Warning
These ultra-aggressive settings prioritize trade frequency over profitability. In the current tests, all trades resulted in losses due to the extremely permissive entry criteria. Consider implementing additional quality filters while maintaining high frequency.
