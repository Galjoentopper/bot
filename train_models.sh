# Enhanced Model Training Script for Trading Bot (Linux)
# ============================================================================
# This script trains models and packages them for easy transfer to Windows trading computer
# Run this on your powerful Linux training computer
#
# Usage:
#   ./train_models.sh                    - Train all models with default settings
#   ./train_models.sh --symbols BTCEUR   - Train only BTCEUR models
#   ./train_models.sh --models lightgbm  - Train only LightGBM models
#
# Checkpoint Options (for 6-hour runtime limits):
#   ./train_models.sh --resume           - Resume from last checkpoint
#   ./train_models.sh --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/custom - Use custom checkpoint directory
# ============================================================================
