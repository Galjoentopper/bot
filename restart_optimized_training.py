Optimized Training Restart Script
================================

This script restarts the BTCEUR training with optimized settings for maximum GPU utilization.
Key optimizations:
- Removed 15GB GPU memory limit
- Disabled mixed precision for speed
- Increased batch sizes (4096 training, 8192 inference)
- Reduced XGBoost complexity for faster training
- Added detailed progress monitoring
